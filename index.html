                        just-released PhotoShoot jQuery plug-in. With it you can convert

                        center and to underscore the firm's open and welcoming style.

                <P><b id="text3">A</b>ncient Roman architecture adopted the external language of classical 
                    Greek architecture for the purposes of the ancient Romans, but grew 
                    so different from Greek buildings as to become a new architectural 
                    style. The two styles are often considered one body of classical 
                    architecture. Roman architecture flourished in the Roman Republic 
                    and even more so under the Empire, when the great majority of 
                    surviving buildings were constructed. It used new materials, 
                    particularly concrete, and newer technologies such as the arch and 
                    the dome to make buildings that were typically strong and 
                    well-engineered. Large numbers remain in some form across the empire, 
                    sometimes complete and still in use.</P>

                    the Greek-speaking people (Hellenic people) whose culture 
                    flourished on the Greek mainland, the Peloponnese, the Aegean 
                    Islands, and in colonies in Anatolia and Italy for a period from 
                    about 900 BC until the 1st century AD, with the earliest remaining 
                    architectural works dating from around 600 BC.[1] Ancient Greek 
                    architecture is best known from its temples, many of which are 
                    found throughout the region, mostly as ruins but many substantially 
                    intact. The second important type of building that survives all 
                    over the Hellenic world is the open-air theatre, with the earliest 
                    dating from around 525-480 BC.

                    earliest remains of recognizable building activity in the India dates
                     back to the Indus Valley cities. Among India's ancient architectural
                      remains, the most characteristic are the temples, Chaityas, 
                      Viharas, Stupas and other religious structures. In ancient India,
                      temple architecture of high standard developed in almost all regions. The distinct architectural style of temple construction in different parts was a result of geographical, climatic, ethnic, racial, historical and linguistic diversities. The Rock-cut structures present the most spectacular piece of ancient Indian art specimen. Most of the rock-cut structures were related to various religious communities.</P>

                <p><b id="text4">T</b>hey were originally bred to herd as well as 
                    guard flocks of sheep. And they were often 
                    left to their own devices in order to accomplish 
                    their assigned tasks. This makes the Briard 
                    different from those breeds that only guard and 
                    those that only herd. The breeds that just herd 
                    are often smaller in size, agile, and swift of 
                    foot. Those breeds that just guard are usually 
                    larger and heavier. Briards were used in all 
                    types of herding situations, having the ability 
                    to learn many commands and fulfill the jobs 
                    expected of them. The Briard was most commonly 
                    used as a farm dog in the more crowded farming 
                    valleys of France, where row crops were grown. 
                    Sheep were allowed to graze the grass strips 
                    between crops and Briards were responsible for 
                    keeping the sheep moving along these strips, 
                    and preventing the sheep from eating the crops. 
                    The Briard moved the sheep daily from the farm 
                    to the graze areas and back again at night.</p>
